Hello Replit team,

3. A digital log of all opportunities:
   - Fields: Status, Type, Organization, Dates, Strength (Strong â€“ Medium â€“ Weak), Notes.

4. Opportunity classification by type:
   - New Project, Partnership, Vendor Registration, Ongoing Project, Project Expansion.

-----------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ 2. Existing Opportunities Management
-----------------------------------

1. Periodic follow-up and updating client records with new developments, especially those that started from past projects.

2. Projects under this category should be cross-linked with the Projects section to track progress and documentation (contracts, reports, payments).

3. Also link these projects to the Business Development module for clear visibility of origin and evolution.

   - Submitted, Under Review, Negotiation, Accepted, Rejected (with optional reason field).

3. File upload field for both technical and financial proposals.

4. Automatic reminders for proposal submission deadlines.

-----------------------------------

All these modules should support dual-language (Arabic/English) and follow the existing UI/UX design pattern of the application.

Let us know if you need mockups or field structures for implementation. Weâ€™re happy to support in ensuring proper alignment.

Thank you!
