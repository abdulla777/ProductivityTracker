Subject: Unacceptable Quality & Unresolved Core Issues â€“ Final Request for a Fully Functional Local System

Hello Team,

I am extremely disappointed with the ongoing status of the project. Despite many rounds of troubleshooting and promises of "final" fixes, the system still does not work as required in a local environment, and new issues are appearing with every iteration.

Current Critical Problems:

Cannot add new projects: "Invalid request method" and other 400 errors persist.

Cannot add new clients/employees: Same blocking errors, nothing works as intended.

Cannot add or view commercial opportunities: The table "opportunities" does not even exist in the database.

UI/UX inconsistencies: Forms throw errors on valid input. Basic CRUD actions are broken.

Database integrity: The SQLite schema is not synchronized with the application logic. Missing tables/columns are a constant issue.

Wasted Time: Every new "fix" brings another regression or a new fatal error.

My Requirements (which were clear from day one):

The system must work 100% locally on my own machine with no cloud, Neon, or third-party dependencies.

All features must be functional: projects, clients, staff, opportunities, attendance, etc.

The system must be delivered fully tested, with all tables/columns created, and without ANY critical/blocking bugs.

NO further experiments with cloud, Neon, or "workarounds" that do not run directly and reliably on my laptop.

My Experience:

I have wasted weeks testing broken builds and reporting detailed logs, only to see the same errors recur.

Your approach of "quick fixes" and patching over errors is not working. This is not professional software delivery.

What I Need Now:

A single ZIP file or Git repo that I can extract, run npm install, run npm run dev, and EVERYTHING WORKS locally, out of the box, with full feature set.

All required database schemas for SQLite created automatically on first run.

Basic acceptance tests passed: add/edit/delete staff, projects, clients, opportunities; record attendance; upload files.

If you cannot provide this, please be honest so I can escalate the matter and seek an alternative solution.

Do not waste any more time with partial fixes. I need a complete, working system or a clear explanation why you are unable to deliver.
