Subject: Critical Issues in HR and Admin Permissions – Role Capabilities & Required Fixes

Dear Team,

After testing the latest release, I have encountered the following critical issues regarding user roles and permissions:

1. HR Manager (hr_manager) cannot access Residency Management
Expected:
HR Manager should be able to access and manage the Residency Management section (إدارة الإقامات).

Actual:
This section is only visible to System Admin. It is hidden for HR Manager, which prevents proper workflow.

2. Leave Requests Are Not Visible to HR Manager
Expected:
When an employee submits a leave request, it should appear in the HR Manager’s notifications or dashboard, for review and approval/rejection.

Actual:
Leave requests do not appear to the HR Manager, and no notification or alert is triggered.

3. Attendance Issues
Expected:
HR Manager should be able to record, edit, and review attendance for all staff, including specifying time and date.

Actual:

Attendance cannot be properly registered by the HR Manager from the dashboard.

The interface lacks controls to set time and date.

The feature is not working as required.

4. Cannot Add Employees (User Accounts)
Expected:
Both System Admin and HR Manager should be able to add new employees/users to the system, assigning them roles.

Actual:
Neither HR Manager nor System Admin can add employees—the Add Employee function is broken or missing.

Summary Table: Roles & What They Should Access
Role	Should See/Do
System Admin	Full access: all modules, all data, settings, users, backup, residency.
HR Manager	Manage users, attendance, leave requests, notifications, residency, HR reports.
General Manager	See reports, projects, clients, attendance, opportunities.
Project Manager	See/manage own projects, assign tasks, view team attendance.
Engineer	See assigned projects, submit attendance, request leave.
Admin Staff	See own attendance, handle assigned tasks.
Regular Staff	See own attendance and leave, submit requests.

Required Fixes:
Grant Residency Management access to HR Manager.

Ensure all leave requests submitted by employees are visible to HR Manager (ideally via notifications or a dashboard).

Fix attendance management UI and backend so HR Manager can fully record and edit staff attendance, including date/time.

Restore/Add the Add Employee function for both System Admin and HR Manager.

Review accessMatrix (RBAC) and permissions logic so every role sees only what they are supposed to, and nothing is missing.

Document in detail what every user role can and cannot access, so future confusion is avoided.

Please treat this as a priority for the production release.
If you need screenshots or step-by-step test scenarios for each role, I am ready to provide them.

Thank you,
