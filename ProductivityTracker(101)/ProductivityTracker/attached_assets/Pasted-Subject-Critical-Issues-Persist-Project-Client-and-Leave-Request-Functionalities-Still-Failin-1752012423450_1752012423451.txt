Subject: ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Persist: Project, Client, and Leave Request Functionalities Still Failing

Dear Team,

Thank you for your continuous efforts to resolve the critical issues. After performing detailed tests, the following critical functionalities still fail despite your recent updates:

Functionality	Status	Notes / Error Message
‚úÖ Add Employee	‚úÖ Working	Successfully tested
‚úÖ Add Task	‚úÖ Working	Successfully tested
‚úÖ Attendance Recording	‚úÖ Working	Successfully tested
‚ùå Add Project	‚ùå Not working	Generic frontend error, no logs appeared in the backend
‚ùå Add Client	‚ùå Not working	Generic frontend error, no logs appeared in the backend
‚ùå Add Leave Request	‚ùå Not working	Frontend error: Invalid request method /api/leave-requests

üîç Immediate Actions Required:
Backend (Node.js/Express):
Verify that the backend correctly receives API requests (POST) from frontend forms.

Double-check API route definitions (server/routes.ts) specifically:

/api/projects endpoint

/api/clients endpoint

/api/leave-requests endpoint (Critical: Fix HTTP method issue)

Frontend (React):
Provide clear and explicit error messages instead of generic ones.

Ensure that the frontend correctly sends valid requests with the correct HTTP method (POST) and payload format.

Database (PostgreSQL):
Re-verify that all fields in projects, clients, and leave_requests tables allow null values.

ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN start_date DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN target_end_date DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE clients ALTER COLUMN created_at DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE leave_requests ALTER COLUMN reason DROP NOT NULL;
üõ°Ô∏è Database Protection & Future Stability (Mandatory):
Due to the critical role this database plays for our company‚Äôs daily operations, please ensure to:

Implement regular daily backups (automated via cron jobs).

Use migration tools (drizzle-kit) for safe future schema changes.

Document all schema and backend changes clearly and comprehensively.

üìù Required Confirmation in Next Response:
Please confirm clearly in your next update:

 Project, client, and leave request functionalities fully tested and working.

 API method definitions explicitly corrected.

 Database schema re-verified and updated to allow nullable fields.

 Comprehensive and clear frontend error handling added.

 Daily backup strategy and migration tools confirmed/documented.

üö® Immediate Attention Needed:
Please prioritize this with urgency and provide an update within the next hour, clearly confirming successful tests and adjustments.

Thank you for your prompt cooperation.

Best regards,
Abdullah
