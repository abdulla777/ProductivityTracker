Hello,

After a detailed review and testing of the application, I’ve compiled a comprehensive list of issues and enhancement requests that are essential to the system's functionality, user experience, and access control.

Please review and implement the following:

---

### ✅ 1. Missing Translations

Many UI texts still appear in Arabic even when the selected language is English. These include:

- "Client Information", "Client Projects", "Notes", "Add", "Edit", "Delete", etc.
- Notes section: "No notes available", "Add a new note..."

🔧 **Fix:** Use the `useTranslation()` hook and update all hardcoded strings. Add proper keys to both `en/common.json` and `ar/common.json`.

---

### 🔐 2. Missing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Currently, all users (including engineers) can:

- Access management-level actions like adding/deleting staff
- View or interact with sections that should be restricted

🔧 **Fix:**
- Only `admin` and `hr` roles should be allowed to add/edit staff
- Restrict buttons and page access based on `user.role`
- Use conditional rendering for sensitive components

---

### ⚠️ 3. Attendance Access Incorrect

- Project Managers and staff can access and view all attendance records and mark attendance for others.

🔧 **Fix:**
- Only `admin` should access global attendance reports
- Staff should only be able to view or record **their own** attendance

---

### 🚫 4. Settings Icon Not Working

The icons in the top navigation bar (Settings ⚙️, Notifications 🔔) currently do nothing on click.

🔧 **Fix:**
- Settings icon should link to the Settings page or open preferences
- Notifications icon should display a panel or show a message like "No new notifications"

---

### 🌐 5. Language Selection Hidden from Staff

Staff cannot change the language since they don’t have access to Settings.

🔧 **Fix:**
- Move the language selector to a globally accessible location (e.g., navbar or sidebar)
- All users, regardless of role, should be able to switch languages

---

### 🧾 6. Staff Services Module Is Missing

The system lacks a section where employees can:

- Request time off (leave, sick days)
- View their attendance history
- Download work certificates or update personal data

🛠 **Suggested addition:** Create a dedicated section (e.g., `Employee Services` or `My HR`) accessible to regular staff, with integration into the HR logic.

---

### 📋 7. Notes Section Improvements

The current notes feature lacks metadata and control:

- Notes have no author or timestamp
- Users cannot edit or delete notes

🔧 **Fix:**
- Store and display note metadata (author + date)
- Add edit/delete controls with permission based on creator or admin role

---

We appreciate the progress made so far, and we’re confident these updates will significantly improve the usability, security, and functionality of the system.

Please let us know once the changes are applied so we can perform another round of testing and feedback.

Thank you!
