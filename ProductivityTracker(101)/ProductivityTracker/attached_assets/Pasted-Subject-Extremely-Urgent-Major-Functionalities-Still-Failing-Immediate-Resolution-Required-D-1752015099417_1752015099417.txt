Subject: 🚨 Extremely Urgent: Major Functionalities Still Failing - Immediate Resolution Required

Dear Team,

Despite multiple confirmations, critical functionalities remain non-operational, which prevents us entirely from launching the application in a production environment.

The current unresolved issues after rigorous testing:

Feature	Status	Error Message	Probable Cause
❌ Project Creation	Failing	Invalid request method /api/projects	Incorrect HTTP method or API misconfiguration
❌ Client Creation	Failing	Invalid request method /api/clients	Incorrect HTTP method or API misconfiguration
❌ Leave Request	Failing	employeeServices.leave.validation.allFields	Frontend validation or payload mismatch
❌ Attendance Recording	Failing	No timestamp/date recorded upon attendance	Backend logic or database issue

🚩 Immediate Required Actions (CRITICAL PRIORITY):
🔴 Backend (Node.js / Express):
Explicitly verify HTTP methods (POST) for:

/api/projects

/api/clients

/api/leave-requests

Thoroughly test and confirm attendance date/time recording functionality in the backend and database.

🔴 Frontend (React):
Correct frontend form submission methods, ensuring explicit use of HTTP POST requests.

Fix validation logic for leave requests, clearly indicate required fields.

🔴 Database & Schema (PostgreSQL):
Confirm columns explicitly accept correct data types (timestamps/dates) and nullable fields.

✅ Mandatory Verification (Before Final Submission):
Please provide explicitly confirmed screenshots and API curl tests clearly demonstrating successful operation for:

 Project creation ✅

 Client creation ✅

 Leave requests ✅

 Employee attendance (with timestamps) ✅

📂 Documentation & Verification:
Ensure accurate and detailed updates:

FINAL_RELEASE_NOTES.md

CRITICAL_FIX_COMPLETE.md

Clearly document the exact solution for each issue.

🚨 Deadline & Priority:
Address these critical issues immediately, with the highest urgency.

Provide confirmed and explicitly verified resolutions within one hour from now.

This is our highest priority, and any delay significantly impacts our operational plans.

Thank you for your immediate action and cooperation.

Best regards,
