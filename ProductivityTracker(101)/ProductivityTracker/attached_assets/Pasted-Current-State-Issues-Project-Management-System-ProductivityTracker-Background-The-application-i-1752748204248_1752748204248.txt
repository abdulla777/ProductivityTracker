Current State & Issues: Project Management System (ProductivityTracker)
Background
The application is intended as a local-only project and HR management system. The system must work fully offline using a local database (no cloud, no external dependencies).
All attempts to stabilize and repair the current system have failed to deliver a reliable or usable local product.

What Works Now?
Project creation and deletion: This is the only feature currently working (partially).

Local SQLite database: The application runs with a local .db file and no internet connection (this is a requirement).

Critical Issues (Blocking Bugs)
Cannot add new clients (companies/organizations).

Cannot add new staff (employees).

Cannot disable or delete staff users.

Attendance logging is completely broken; all attendance-related buttons are non-functional and there are multiple redundant icons (should be merged to one).

Cannot add tasks to any project.

Cannot add business opportunities (opportunities module is broken).

Cannot submit or manage leave requests (employee leave).

Database schema problems: Missing fields/columns (notes, phase_id, client_notes.project_id, etc.) and unsupported functions like now.

Repeated SQLITE errors: The migration from PostgreSQL to SQLite was incomplete and caused further breakage.

The system was working better in older releases (before recent database/script changes).

What the New Team Must Do
Deliver a local/offline system (no cloud, no external database required).

All core CRUD operations must work for:

Projects

Employees

Clients

Attendance (check-in/check-out, daily logs)

Tasks

Leaves (requests, approvals)

Business Opportunities

Database schema must match the actual application needs (all required fields/columns must exist).

All main features must be accessible and functional from the UI.

Attendance should be logged and reflected in the dashboard with a single, clear button.

If needed, rebuild the system from scratch (with PostgreSQL or SQLite, as long as it works 100% offline).

Technical Note
The current codebase is inconsistent—backend is full of legacy PostgreSQL code, while the database is now SQLite (causing many SQL and runtime errors).

Multiple critical bugs, schema mismatches, and unhandled exceptions.

The code is currently unfit for production or even limited local use.

Attachments
Full log files, screenshots, and step-by-step reproduction available for all bugs and UI flows.

Summary
The project is not usable in its current state.
A reliable, fully local solution is required—even if it means starting over.
I’m available for technical clarifications or more logs/screenshots if needed.
