Hi team,

Thanks for the recent update. Here is a summary of the current system issues and required improvements:

Current Issues Remaining:
Leave Request Approval Workflow

When an employee submits a leave request, it does not appear in the employee's own leave request list.

In the HR Manager dashboard, when clicking "View All" under leave requests, no requests are displayed (even those already submitted or approved/rejected).

There is no full leave request log: The HR Manager cannot view previous leave requests or their status (approved/rejected/pending).

After the HR Manager approves or rejects a leave request, there is no notification sent back to the employee (the employee should receive a clear notification/alert for any action taken on their request).

Residency Management

The HR Manager can now access the Residency page, but data is incomplete or not accurate.

When adding a new employee whose residency expires in less than 3 months, no notification is triggered in the alerts section.

Backup & Restore

Backup and restore functionality is not working or does not respond in the UI.

(Previously solved) The "Register Attendance" button has been removed from the dashboard â€“ thank you.

Required Fixes and Improvements:
Employees must be able to see their submitted leave requests and their current status.

The HR Manager must see all leave requests in the "View All" page, with full log/history including status (pending/approved/rejected), and must be able to review past decisions.

Notifications must be sent to the employee whenever their leave request is approved or rejected by the HR Manager.

Residency notifications must trigger correctly if an employee's residency will expire in less than 3 months, and data in the Residency Management page must be accurate.

Backup and restore features should work as described, with no UI or backend errors.

Please focus on these points in your next update.
If you need more technical details or reproduction steps, let us know.
Thanks for your attention and effort!
