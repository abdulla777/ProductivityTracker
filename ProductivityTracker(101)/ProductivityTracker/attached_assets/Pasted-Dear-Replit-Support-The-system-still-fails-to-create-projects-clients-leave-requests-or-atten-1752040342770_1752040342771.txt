Dear Replit Support,

The system still fails to create projects, clients, leave requests, or attendance records through the frontend. The following critical issues remain unresolved:

❌ Project creation fails with `Invalid request method /api/projects`
❌ Client creation fails with `Invalid request method /api/clients`
❌ Leave requests fail with `Invalid request method /api/leave-requests`
❌ Attendance registration fails, and check-in/out times are not saved

From the backend terminal, the logs confirm the frontend is sending malformed or incorrect HTTP requests.

✔️ However, when we test the same endpoints using curl, all POST requests succeed, and the data is stored correctly.

This indicates that the frontend's fetch() API is either:
- Sending the wrong HTTP method (e.g., GET instead of POST),
- Not including the session cookie properly (causing 401 errors),
- Or missing required headers (Content-Type: application/json).

Please do the following urgently:

1. Review all frontend `fetch` or `apiRequest` methods for:
   - Correct HTTP method (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE),
   - Proper headers (especially `Content-Type` and cookie),
   - Correct endpoint path (should not have typos like `.projects` or missing slashes),
   - Ensure all requests are authenticated (include session/cookie/token properly).

2. Fix project creation: Ensure the request uses POST and includes `createdBy` or extract from session automatically on the backend.

3. Fix client creation and leave request forms: Validate frontend input fields are correctly passed as JSON and the HTTP method is POST.

4. Attendance: Ensure time format is sent correctly (e.g., "HH:MM") and stored with timestamps. Currently, no timestamps are saved.

Please verify all fetch calls match this working curl format:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"test","description":"desc", ...}' \
  -b session_cookie.txt
Let me know as soon as it's resolved. This is urgent for production deploymen
